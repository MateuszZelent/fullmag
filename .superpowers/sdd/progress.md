## Global constraints

- Native mixed topology is `prism6` in the magnet, `pyramid5` only in air transition, and `tet4` in far air; facets are `tri3 | quad4`.
- `layers=1` means exactly two magnetic node planes.
- Strict mode never silently splits or falls back to tetrahedra.
- Unsupported physics and topology combinations fail before backend startup.
- FEM builds and runtime proof use repository container-backed `just` recipes first.
- Preserve the dirty master checkout and the user-owned SP4 scenario edit.
